# Task Manager REST API

A simple RESTful Task Manager API built with Java and Spring Boot that supports full CRUD operations and data persistence using Spring Data JPA and an H2 in-memory database.

## What I Built

 * REST API to create, read, update, and delete tasks

 * Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)

 * Data persistence with JPA and Hibernate

 * Proper HTTP status codes and response handling

 * In-memory H2 database with auto-generated schema

## What I Learned

 * How Spring Boot auto-configures applications

 * Designing RESTful endpoints using Spring MVC

 * Using Spring Data JPA repositories and derived queries

 * Handling optional values and errors cleanly

 * Connecting and persisting data with H2 and Hibernate

## Tech Stack

 * Language: Java 17

 * Framework: Spring Boot

 * Web: Spring Web (REST APIs)

 * Persistence: Spring Data JPA, Hibernate

 * Database: H2 (in-memory)

 * Build Tool: Maven

 * Server: Embedded Tomcat

## Future Improvements

 * Create a frontend page that talks to this API

 * Write unit and integration tests

 * Add API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
